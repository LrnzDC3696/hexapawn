## What is Hexpawn?

Hexapawn is a simple two-player board game which has it's origins in chess and was developed by Martin Gardner in 1962. It is played on a mere 3x3 rectangular board and as the name hexapawn indicates, all the pieces on the board are exclusively pawns. Unlike chess, the board size can vary, as well as the amount of pawns (proportional to the board size). The game was initially constructed in order to demonstrate how it could be played by a heuristic AI implemented by a mechanical computer.

#### How to play Hexapawn

On a board size `n*m`, each player begins with `m` pawns, one for each square in the row closest to them. The goal of each player is to advance one of their pawns to the opposite end of the board or to prevent the other player from moving.

#### Rules

Just like in chess, each pawn may be moved in two different ways:
1. One Square forward
2. One Square diagonally to capture a other pawn

A pawn may not be moved forward if there is a pawn in the next square. Contrary to chess, the first move of a pawn may not advance it by two spaces. A player loses if the have no legal moves or the other player reaches the end of the board with a pawn. Since each pawn can only move forward, there is no need for a draw by repetition rule.

### Variants

As the board size can vary the rules can be naturally extended to larger boards. Also, the pawns can be replaced by [Berolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berolina_chess) pawns or [Berolina Plus pawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berolina_chess).
